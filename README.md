# Casino
This was my very first coding project ever. I did this in high schoool and it's kinda bad. It's supposed to be a casino system with different customer tiers and rewards depending on how long they've been going to the casino for. The "games" that the user is able to play are not very exciting, specially since the main purpose of the project was to practice AOOP concepts. Still I decided to leave it unchanged from what I originally created since I think it's cool to look back to what I've done in the past.
